SkillBridge - Personal Learning Dashboard 📚
A personal project exploring mobile app development with React Native and Expo. This is my take on creating a modern learning management interface with a focus on clean design and smooth user experience.
🎯 What This Project Is
This is a personal learning project where I'm experimenting with:

React Native & Expo development
Custom font integration (PT Sans)
Dark theme UI design
File-based routing with Expo Router
Tailwind CSS styling with NativeWind

Note: This is not a commercial product or production-ready application. It's purely for learning and portfolio purposes.
✨ Features I'm Building

📊 Dashboard Interface - Clean stats and progress tracking UI
📚 Course Catalog - Browse and view course information
💼 Job Board Mock - Practice building job listing interfaces
🎯 Skills Tracker - Visual skill progression components
💬 Chat UI - Messaging interface design
🔔 Notifications - Alert and notification systems
